							The Pride month celebrates LGBTQIA+ communities all across the
							world, their rights and culture. It is marked by a spirit of
							resistance and acceptance as opposed to an attitude of shame.
							Pride is now recognised as a massive celebration including
							marches, protests and parades. People gather in huge numbers
							across the world and express themselves in myriad forms. The
							original event that is commemorated by these parades, dates back
							to 28 June 1969, known as the Stonewall Uprising.

						<p class="lt">
							Teachers and professors do not openly support LGBT students and

							often by their own classmates or peers.

						<p class="lt">
							While some parents openly berate their wards, others ask them to
							keep mum or explore conversion therapy that can cause lasting
							psychological damage to the kids. Young kids hesitate coming out
							as LGBT because they fear rejection from their parents and their
							community.

						<h2 class="probh">Homelessness</h2>
						<p class="lt">
							Some parents ask LGBT teens to leave their homes without any
							career or educational prospects. This leads to kids being
							displaced and their financial support is cut off. It increases
							risk of depression, suicidal thoughts and even substance abuse in
							some LGBT youth.

								Make sure to support your LGBTQ friends by including them in
								plans, inviting them to meet your family or just hanging out
								with them in general. Don’t make them feel as if they’re someone
								you want to hide or keep away from the rest of your social
								circle. Also include the partner of your LGBT loved one in
								events and activities just as you would any other spouse or
								significant other.

						<div class="card-body">
							<h5 class="card-title">Speak up</h5>
							<p class="card-text lt">
								Being a good friend or family member means having your LGBTQ
								friend’s back. If you hear someone using a slur, making a
								disparaging remark or telling a joke that stereotypes LGBTQ
								people, speak out against it — even if it isn’t directed at your
								loved one or they’re not around. Make sure others know that you

						<div class="card-body">
							<h5 class="card-title">Just listen</h5>
							<p class="card-text lt">
								More than anything, be a good listener. It’s better to hear
								someone out than to talk yourself when it comes to a matter you
								yourself don’t have firsthand experience with. Listen when your
								LGBTQ friends and family members need to vent about their
								experiences, cry about injustices their community faces or ask
								for your help as an ally.

							<h5 class="card-title">Don’t question their identity</h5>
							<p class="card-text lt">
								You will meet LGBTQ people who simply don’t line up with the
								common stereotypes at all. If someone tells you their sexual
								orientation or gender identity, believe them. Don’t push back
								against or question their identity because they don’t fit what
								you’d expect. For example, if someone tells you that they’re
								queer or bisexual, don’t ask them whether they’re sure they’re
								not actually just gay.
